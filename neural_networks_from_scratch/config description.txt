The valid keys in global variables:
It starts with GLOBAL
There must be a comma (,) between each key and value
'loss': The loss function (mse, or cross_entropy)
'lrate': The global learning rate (a float number)
'wreg': The regulerization rate (a float number)
'wrt': The regulerization function (L1 or L2)
'minibatchsize': The size of minibatches (integer number)
'epochs': How many times to repeat (integer number)
'verbos': If 0 it will not print the information and if 1 or any other value it will print

The valid keys in layers part which starts with LAYERS:
There must be a comma (,) between each key and value
'input': input dimentions (it must be n*n*minibatch size where n is the dimention of the image)
'type': This must just be in the last line which means the output layer to inform if there is a softmax output layer (softmax or none)
'act': The activation function for this layer (sigmoid, relu, linear or tanh)
'wr': The intervall of the weigths start for this layer (example: (-0.1;0.1) separated by ;)
lrate: The learning rate for this layer (a float number)
'br': The start bias for this layer (0 or 1)
'size': How many neurons in this layer (an integer)

The valid keys in images generator part which starts with GENERATOR:
There must be a comma (,) between each key and value
'count': How many images to be generated ( an integer)
'height': The image height (an integer)
'width': The image width (an integer)
'ndim': The image dimention size n (an integer)
	height and width of the image must be lower than ndim
'noise': The number of pixels with noise in the image (an integer)
'test': The test set persentage of the whole set (an integer between 0 and 100)
'valid': The validation set persentage of the whole set (an integer between 0 and 100)
'train': The training set persentage of the whole set (an integer between 0 and 100)
